# Shortest distance between two nodes in a graph.
## Before you proceed to check the task, please take note of the following points:
* This application follows **Djikstras** algorithm for calculating optimised(minimum) cost of travelling between any two entered nodes.
    * *Dijkstra's algorithm (or Dijkstra's Shortest Path First algorithm, SPF algorithm) is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph, which may represent, for example, road networks.*
* Please enter integers to mark nodes and cost between the nodes and keep the number of nodes continuous. Attaching a snapshot for example.

* For disconnected nodes the distance returned will be 10,000.
* Please fill in all of the text boxes for creating graph as well as calculating distance between two specified nodes.
